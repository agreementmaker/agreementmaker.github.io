Hello everyone,

AgreementMaker 0.23 is now available for download. Several changes have been
made including:

* "Jena TDB":https://jena.apache.org/documentation/tdb integration allowing to load ontologies to an on disk directory location. This is useful if you’re working with large ontologies.

</div>

The Lexicon builder can now select the properties which are synonym properties and which are definition properties (previously we just used “hasSynonym” and “hasDefinition”). This is useful for dealing with non-standard annotations.

Several algorithms have been extended to allow for “annotation profiling”, letting the user choose which annotations and properties are used in the the computation of the similarity metrics. Previously, the algorithms were hard coded with the standard annotations, such as rdfs:label, rdfs:comment, etc.

... plus several bug fixes.
